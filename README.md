A simple example of how we can evaluate LLM RAG Applications with Arize Phoenix

This repository walks through simple chunking to build a basic RAG application with its focus mainly being on how to effectively evaluate RAG pipelines. Arize Phoenix is an open-source library which allows for direct traceability/observability in a web UI. As an example, a .pdf is chunked and loaded, then questions are asked against retrieved context to the LLM. 

You can access the Phoenix traceability Web UI at http://localhost:6006/
